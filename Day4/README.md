# ðŸ“˜ Day 4 â€“ JavaScript Operators

Operators in JavaScript are used for **mathematical** and **logical computations**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ What Are Operators?
Operators are special symbols used to perform operations on values and variables.  
For example:
- The **assignment operator** `=` assigns values.
- The **addition operator** `+` adds values.
- The **multiplication operator** `*` multiplies values.
- The **comparison operator** `>` compares values.

## ðŸ”¹ Types of JavaScript Operators
There are several categories of operators in JavaScript:

1. **Arithmetic Operators**
2. **Assignment Operators**
3. **Comparison Operators**
4. **Logical Operators**
5. **Other Special Operators**

## ðŸ”¹ Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical calculations on numbers.

| Operator | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `+`  | Addition |
| `-`  | Subtraction |
| `*`  | Multiplication |
| `**` | Exponentiation (power) |
| `/`  | Division |
| `%`  | Modulus (division remainder) |
| `++` | Increment (increase by 1) |
| `--` | Decrement (decrease by 1) |

---

## ðŸ”¹ Assignment Operators
Assignment operators assign values to variables.  
They can also be used to update existing values in a shorter way.

| Operator | Example | Same As |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `=`   | `x = y` | `x = y` |
| `+=`  | `x += y` | `x = x + y` |
| `-=`  | `x -= y` | `x = x - y` |
| `*=`  | `x *= y` | `x = x * y` |
| `/=`  | `x /= y` | `x = x / y` |
| `%=`  | `x %= y` | `x = x % y` |
| `**=` | `x **= y` | `x = x ** y` |

---

## ðŸ”¹ Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare values.  
They return a **Boolean value**: `true` or `false`.

| Operator | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `==`   | Equal to |
| `===`  | Equal value and equal type |
| `!=`   | Not equal |
| `!==`  | Not equal value or not equal type |
| `>`    | Greater than |
| `<`    | Less than |
| `>=`   | Greater than or equal to |
| `<=`   | Less than or equal to |

---

## ðŸ”¹ Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to combine or invert conditions.

| Operator | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `&&` | Logical AND (true if **both** conditions are true) |
| `||` | Logical OR (true if **at least one** condition is true) |
| `!`  | Logical NOT (reverses the result) |
